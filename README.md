# CS565-Final-Project

## About

The following repository contains the implementation and documentation for the Portland State University CS565 final project. It implements a browser-based multi-player [TETRIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) game, in which two players are able to compete against one-another in real-time. It is used to explore and demonstrate frontend and backend web technologies.

A journal of the design process, decisions, and major commits/branches is retained within this codebase in [`docs/journal.md`](./docs/journal.md)

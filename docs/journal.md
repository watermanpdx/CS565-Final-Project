## Project Initialization Hello World

Branch: `project-setup`
PR: <insert reference here>

In this (basic) branch `project-setup` I initialized the basic project base with the root `README.md`, `docs/` folder for containing `journal.md`, and the initial Node configuration. Installed packages include `nodemon` (dev) to support future development a bit easier (prevent stopping and starting the server manually) and `express` for the server. Placed in `src` is `server.js` which contains a simple "Hello World" GET response to just get the setup working.

I initially debated separating out the folder structure into a backend, frontend, and packages folder structure with a root and recursive `package.json` files for modularity... but decided instead to "keep it simple", at least for the initial implementation. I may revisit this if maintaining the contents in one structure become too difficult to manage. However, considering the scope of the scope of this project should be limited; one shared folder structure may be sufficient.

## Game "Engine"

Branch: [`tetris-engine`](https://github.com/watermanpdx/CS565-Final-Project/tree/feature/tetris-engine)
Commit: [ac9fc39](https://github.com/watermanpdx/CS565-Final-Project/commit/ac9fc398c7e15015450610869017b57e9344cc54)

In this update I chose to first focus on the implementation of the base TETRIS implementation. As the website will be a multi-player TETRIS game, this is a core feature which is foundational to the purpose of the site, and must be available (at least in an initial form) to build the other features off of.

I chose to implement the TETRIS game within its own dedicated JavaScript file `tetris.js` to isolate it as a module for use within other JavaScript/Node components. I believe that this is also necessary to prevent "tangling" of code due to poor separation of concerns. I would like the contents of `tetris.js` to be focused **solely** on the game mechanics, and be abstracted from how the game is actually interacted with and viewed. That is, I want code elsewhere to define and bind what keys/event link to game actions, and "render" game states into a visual tetris game.

I initially linked the implementation of `tetris.js` into the backend code within `./backend/server.js` in an attempt to limit focus to the TETRIS implementation and **not** start on **React**... however, I found very quickly that this was impractical. My initial implementation "rendered" the game board to the terminal via `console.log()`, which helped to get started, but quickly ran into issues. In order to test user-input and special game-states like "a full row", it was too cumbersometo do this by hard-coding states and viewing it in the terminal; I found that I needed user-input and a basic, visual rendering to make progress on the game implementation.

For fear of coding myself "into a corner", I chose to build the basic frontent on [React](https://react.dev/) directly, rather than investing in (even simple) "vanilla" html and JavaScript. I separated out my frontend and backend into dedicated project subfolders `./frontend/` and `./backend/` to prevent confusion and clutter between the two implementations. For this stage of the implementation, I chose not to invest too heavily on React to keep focus on the TETRIS implementation. I built the initial frontend heavily following tutorials and online troubleshooting to "just get it running" ([React Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/), [Handling Events](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27827234/how-to-handle-the-onkeypress-event-in-reactjs), [Resolving Issues with "Danlging" Event-Listeners](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/guides/event-listeners-in-react-components)). I acknowledge at this stage my React code may not be optimal. I intend to focus on this during later stages focusing on the frontend.

Using this, I was able to get an initial, basic TETRIS game up and running, and rendering in the browser. For this stage I chose to move the `tetris.js` implementation from the backend to the frontend to focus on the game-to-browser interaction. In future revisions, I will implement [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) communication to link the frontend to game "engine", however for this initial step, I added directly to the frontend to reduce complexity. To support my desired separation of rendering and user-input from the game, all events are handled within the React code, and all games states are manages by `testris.js`. The React frontend binds keyboard events into `game` action calls, and the `game` object returns at each iteration an array of the board to be rendered and displayed. The frontend also cyclically calls the `update()` method of `game` to increment it in real-time. This will be removed from the frontend in future implmentations; it should not be in its scope.

In managing the visualization of the TETRIS game, I implemented a dedicated `Tetris.css` style-sheet for the contents of the game. Although I intend on using [https://getbootstrap.com/](Bootstrap) for most of my frontend styling, I think I will likely keep this dedicated style-sheet as its own file, and manually edited ("vanilla" css). Reasoning being, that the styling of the game contents itself, are very different from web-contents; they define specific game object (blocks, etc) colors and relative sizes. I do not expect them to need to (nor want them) to align to stylings for the webpage itself. Keeping this content as its own file keeps it separate from web-contents.

For the TETRIS implementation itself, I chose to implement the game and its contained objects (blocks) as Javascript `classes`. From previous experience, this is a common pattern that I have used in simulated, animated environments like this and choose to reuse this pattern. Again, given that the core game "engine" should be separated from webpage rendering and presentation, I don't believe that this should be an issue; and makes management of the game a bit easier (at least personally). I structured the game into a main `Tetris` `class` which is the sole object exported as a `module` for use externally. It is responsible for the game state, animation methods, and scoring. As the game is composed of many "blocks" which behave very similarly, I chose to implement a `Block` `class` which is contained and managed within `Tetris` containing all of the methods for managing block actions (move, rotate, check for collisions, etc.). Each specific block is a derived class of `Block` defining specific attributes such as it block-type, geometry, and rotations, initial position, etc.

Initially, I considered defining a base "sprite" for each block and implementing a rotation transformation when called... but found quickly that defining where the "center" of rotation was, and dealing with rounding became logically problematic quickly. Instead, I chose to simply reference the [TETRIS rotations](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/DTET_Rotation_System) directly and store them as a pre-computed array that gets indexed with rotation. (Likewise, for scoring I referenced the [TETRIS scoring](https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/Scoring) directly rather than coming up with my own scoring scheme).

Some minor challenges I encountered worth noting. My internal game state (the grid of cells) is a multi-dimensional array; arrays within another array. I needed to distinguish between the current rendering window and a "base" rendering window. This is because the "active" block continually moves down the screen. I wanted to avoid having to constantly "clean up" old renderings of the block's last position, but still keep the "landed" blocks. To do this I implemented a "base" grid which contains all of the "landed" blocks, and a "current" grid which is the "base" grid + the current position of the active block. Since I have an array of arrays, I had to look out for shallow-copying and "leaking" changes to my "current" grid into my "base" grid. [Multi-Dimensional Array Copying](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13756482/create-copy-of-multi-dimensional-array-not-reference-javascript).

I also learned that `classes` do not "hoist". That is, `classes` cannot be referenced above their implementation. I therefore had to pay attention to both where I implemented by derived and used `classes`, but also had to make sure the `export` declaration for `Tetris` was at the bottom of the file. I'm still not convinced that there may be some clever trick or better practice to bring this to the top... I plan to revisit this later in final code review; it works but I don't like that seeing what is exported requires navigating all the way to the bottom of the file...

Last, I ended this update without implementing rendering of the score, and showing the "next" block. My growing feeling is that these pieces may be their own components in React, and that I may be building too many frontend-to-`tetris.js` dependencies. Rather than continuing development of these features in this update, I've chosen to leave it as-is for now, and instead focus on the Socket.IO separation next. In the next major update I want to split out the frontend and backend concerns over Socket.IO and complete the full game rendering in React.
